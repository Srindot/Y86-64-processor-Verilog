# Y86-64 Processor in Verilog

This repository contains an implementation of a **Y86-64** processor built in **Verilog**. The Y86-64 architecture is a simplified version of x86-64, designed for educational purposes while maintaining key features such as instruction pipelining and memory operations.

### Features:
- Fully functional **Y86-64 ISA support**
- Instruction **fetch, decode, execute, memory, and write-back stages**
- **Hazard detection and forwarding** mechanisms
- **Memory and register file implementation**
- Designed for **simulation and testing in Verilog**

This project serves as a foundation for exploring processor design, pipelining techniques, and computer architecture concepts.
